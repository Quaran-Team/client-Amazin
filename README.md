# client-Amazin

This is the client (front-end) side of our Amazin' project created by Talent Path's 'Quaran-Team!' of full stack developers.

The plan was to practice weekly agile sprints by creating an e-commerce product page(s) for 20-50 items in a very similar theme to that big one named after the giant river in South America.

Each team member has made contributions to both client (front - end) and server (back - end) sides of the project connecting their data to their components.

The server can be found here _-_ GitHub Repo = https://github.com/Quaran-Team/server-Amazin .

And live deployed at ... {}.

We did not use create-react-app from command line, but we did use react to conjure up our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It is configured via webpack and package. json using node modules.
We limited the number of external libraries and frameworks as much as possible.
Due to time constraints some parts are just static mocks, while others are fully dynamic.

To run it locally:
1- clone down the repo
2- run 'npm install' in the command line to get all the node modules locally

If you are unfamiliar with npm visit https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

once that is done run

3- run 'npm start' to boot up a localhost version in your default web browser via command line


4- it should open to localhost:3000/

you can click on any of the products squares to jump to that page

hit the back button to return to our main page 

or just add /singleItem/1 to the end of the url to see our first item

5- to see all pages simply change the number at the end to any between 1 & 20

e.g. localhost:3000/singleItem/5 or localhost:3000/singleItem/17


Most things will not appear correctly without also having the server running.

(those instructions are on the server GitHub link above ^)

'npm test' will run all the tests we made
